# Collaborative Learning for Cyber Security Detection in Blockchain Network

This project focuses on detecting cyber threats in blockchain networks using AI-based collaborative learning.  
It enhances data security through decentralized and privacy-preserving techniques.  
Blockchain ensures transparency, while AI improves detection accuracy.  
Federated learning allows multiple nodes to train models without sharing raw data.  
The system identifies attacks like DDoS, phishing, and malware.  
Python is used for implementing and simulating detection algorithms.  
It combines AI, blockchain, and IoT technologies for secure communication.  
Collaborative learning increases efficiency and reduces attack risk.  
The project supports real-time monitoring in distributed environments.  
It prevents single-point failures by decentralizing control.  
This approach ensures data integrity and network resilience.  
It can be applied in IoT, banking, and cloud security systems.  
The project demonstrates AIâ€™s role in modern blockchain cybersecurity.  
Developed by **P. Komal** under the guidance of **B. Anil Kumar**.# project-code
